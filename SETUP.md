# 🚀 Nuvio Scrapers - Fixed Setup Guide

Your repository has been automatically restructured to match the working version. Here's what was done and how to use it.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Reorganized file structure** - Moved providers to `src/providers/` directory
2. **Updated manifest.json** - All provider paths now point to `src/providers/`
3. **Added build.js** - Automated build script to compile providers
4. **Added server.js** - Local development server for testing

## 📁 New Directory Structure

```
Kjs-main/
├── src/
│   └── providers/
│       ├── 4khubdad.js
│       ├── moviesdrive.js
│       └── vegamovies.js
├── providers/        (auto-generated from build process)
├── manifest.json     (updated to reference src/providers/)
├── build.js          (NEW - build script)
├── server.js         (NEW - dev server)
├── package.json
└── ... (other files)
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. **Local Development & Testing**

Start the local server:
```bash
node server.js
```

Then access it in Nuvio app:
- Go to Settings → Local Scrapers
- Add: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Enable the scrapers you want

### 2. **Build for Distribution**

When you want to publish/update:
```bash
node build.js
```

This automatically copies your providers from `src/providers/` to `providers/` directory.

### 3. **Deploy to GitHub**

Push the updated repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update to src/providers structure"
git push origin main
```

Now users can add your repository URL directly in Nuvio:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KotlinJS5/Kjs/main/
```

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Edit providers in `src/providers/`** - This is where your source code lives
- **The `providers/` folder** is auto-generated by `build.js` during deployment
- **manifest.json is already updated** to point to `src/providers/`
- Both folder structures will work with Nuvio app

## ⚙️ Making Changes to Providers

1. Edit your JavaScript files in `src/providers/`
2. Test locally with `node server.js`
3. Run `node build.js` before pushing to GitHub
4. Commit and push

## 🧪 Testing Your Scrapers

Test a specific scraper:
```bash
node test.js
```

Or manually test providers by accessing them through the server:
```
http://localhost:8080/src/providers/4khubdad.js
```

## ✨ Next Steps

1. Run `node build.js` to prepare for distribution
2. Test with `node server.js` if needed
3. Push to GitHub
4. Share your repository URL with users

Your repository is now properly structured and ready to use! 🎉
